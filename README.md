# HoloLens Object Detection
Perform on-device object detection with the YOLO detector on a HoloLens, powered by the Barracuda Inference Engine. 

The code is based on a project I conducted during my [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/janedoesrepo/HoloLens-ObjectDetection/blob/main/Masterthesis_v3.3_final.pdf) with the title "Four Eyes see more than two: Machine Learning-based Object Detection in Augmented Reality" at the Technical University of Darmstadt and the University of Cambridge.

**Using:**
 - Unity Editor 2019.4.29f1
 - Unity Barracuda
 - PyTorch

I am currently negotiating an Open-Source solution of this project with the stakeholders involved. Until this is finalized, unfortunately no code can be published.
