# HoloLens-ObjectDetection
Perform on-device object detection with Tiny YOLOv2 (further versions coming) on a HoloLens, powered by the Barracuda Inference Engine. 

This is the adaption of a joint project I conducted during my Master's Thesis with the Technical University of Darmstadt and the University of Cambridge.

Work in progress
